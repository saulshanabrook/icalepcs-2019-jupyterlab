Thursday at 10 am sounds good. Rough outline:

1. Introduce and demo jupyterlab: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/blob/master/narrative/jupyterlab.md
2. Tutorial on getting started creating a jupyterlab extension from a cookiecutter https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts
3. Go over upcoming JupyterLab features (dataregistry, real time collaboration)


JupyterLab is the next generation of the notebook interface. This talk will start with an overview of the JupyterLab
interface to show how it can be used for more than just editing notebooks.  JupyterLab was designed with extensibility
in mind, so next I will show how to create a plugin that adds custom functionality to the interface. Then I will show
some existing extensions that target the scientific ecosystem, including support for exploring HDF5 files. Finally,
I will end with an exploration of new features coming to JupyterLab including real time collaboration.
